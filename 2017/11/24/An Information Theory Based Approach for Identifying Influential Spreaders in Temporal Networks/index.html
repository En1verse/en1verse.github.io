<p><strong>Abstract</strong>.Identifying the most influential nodes in computer networks<br>is an important issue in preventing the spread of computer viruses. In<br>order to quantify the importance of nodes in the spreading of computer<br>viruses, various centrality measures have been developed under<br>an assumption of a static network. These measures have limitations in<br>that many network structures are dynamically change over time. In this<br>paper, we extend an entropy-based centrality from time-independent networks<br>to time-dependent networks by taking into account the temporal<br>and spatial connections between different nodes simultaneously. We also<br>propose an algorithm for ranking the influences of nodes. According to<br>the experimental results on three synthetic networks and a real network<br>for susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) spreading model, our proposed<br>temporal entropy-based centrality (TEC) is more accurate than existing<br>temporal betweenness, and closeness centralities.</p>

<p>##1 Introduction</p>
<p>Finding the most influential spreaders is of critical importance in preventing<br>and controlling the spread of computer viruses over email networks, computer<br>networks, or social networks [1]. At present, a lot of centrality measures have<br>been presented to identify the most influential spreaders in networks such as the<br>degree centrality, closeness centrality, betweenness centrality, K-shell centrality,<br>and eigenvector centrality [2]. However, most of these measures are defined<br>based on a static network model with the assumption that nodes and edges in<br>the network are fixed. However, many networks in the real world such as email<br>networks are time-awareness and not static. New nodes or edges in the networks<br>may appear at any time, and old nodes or edges may disappear as well. The<br>networks that contain a series of time-ordered graphs over a set of nodes are<br>often named as temporal networks. Figure 1 shows a toy temporal network with<br>six nodes as an example. Due to the dynamics of topological structures in temporal<br>networks, the traditional centrality measures do not suit to quantify the<br>influences of nodes.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Although temporal networks are ubiquitous, there are few metrics for locating<br>the most influential spreaders in such temporal networks. Tang et al. [3]<br>proposed a temporal closeness centrality (TCC) and a temporal betweenness<br>centrality (TBC) to identify important nodes in time-dependent networks from<br>a communication perspective. The temporal closeness centrality aims to find<br>nodes with a fastest speed to spread a piece of information, while the temporal<br>betweenness centrality focuses on the classification of nodes that behave as key<br>mediators in the communication over time. Takaguchi et al. [4] defined fastest<br>temporal paths on a network and based on which they defined temporal coverage<br>centrality and temporal boundary coverage centrality. Rocha et al. [5] and<br>Estrada et al. [6] estimated the roles of nodes in propagation process based on<br>the random walk theory. Praprotnik and Batagelj [7] extended the matrix-based<br>centralities in time-independent network such as eigenvector centrality and Katz<br>centrality to temporal networks. Taylor et al. [8] further generalized the eigenvector<br>centrality. They also presented two additional metrics, namely as marginal<br>and conditional centralities, with the aim of facilitating the capture of centrality<br>trajectories. However, these measures seldom consider the relationships between<br>nodes’ influences at different time snapshot. Intuitively, if a node connects to<br>more nodes that have more neighbors in the subsequent time snapshots, the<br>node may be a more important spreader.</p>
<p>From this point of view, this paper contributes to extend the entropy-based<br>centrality [9] from a static network to a temporal network based on the information<br>theory. As defined by Shannon [10], entropy is an effective way to measure<br>the uncertainty of the outcomes when an event happens. In the scenario of computer<br>virus spreading, a node may have a higher uncertainty on its outcome if<br>it connects to more nodes in a snapshot. That means, if an infected node has<br>more uninfected neighbors, it is more difficult to predict how many neighbors<br>it will infect. Thus the node has a larger entropy. Furthermore, based on the<br>observation on the propagation process of computer viruses, we have found that<br>if a node has more neighbors in a snapshot, and its neighbors have more neighbors<br>in the future, the node may be more influencing. This is easy to understand<br>because if the neighbors of an infected node will connects to more nodes in the<br>subsequent time snapshots, the node may have a higher probability to infect<br>more nodes after several time steps. Furthermore, we also propose a recursion<br>algorithm, namely as “Information Theory-based Temporal Centrality Calculation”<br>ITTCC algorithm to calculate the influence for each node in a temporal<br>network.</p>
<p>The proposed temporal entropy-based centrality (TEC) estimates the importance<br>of a node by considering both the magnitude of its degree in each snapshot<br>as well as the influences of its neighbors in the subsequent time. In order to<br>examine the effectiveness of TEC in identifying vital nodes, we apply it to a toy<br>temporal network (as shown in Fig. 1) to demonstrate its calculation process.<br>Based on the classic SIR spreading model, we also compare the proposed metric<br>on three synthetic temporal networks and a real-world temporal email network<br>with other two centrality measures, i.e., temporal betweenness centrality (TBC)<br>and temporal closeness centrality (TCC) [3]. The experiment results show that<br>our method is able to find more influential spreaders in temporal networks.</p>
<p>The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces<br>the TEC and the corresponding ITTCC algorithm. Section 2 also presents a<br>numerical example to show the calculation process of the TEC based on the toy<br>temporal network as shown in Fig. 1. Section 3 evaluates our method based on<br>three synthetic networks and a real-world email network. Section 4 concludes the<br>whole work and highlights the main contribution.</p>
<p>##2 Temporal Entropy-Based Centrality and ITTCC Algorithm</p>
<p>###2.1 Definitions for Temporal Entropy-Based Centrality</p>
<p>The metric of TEC is defined based on a temporal network model. Incorporating<br>the definitions given from [3], a temporal network G can be defined as an ordered<br>sequence of undirected and unweighted graphs {G1, G2, …, GT } with a node set<br>V = {v1, v2, …vN } and a given time period T, where Gt = (V,Et) (t ∈ T). Here,<br>Et = {(vi, vj , t)} (∀i, ∀j ∈ V ) is the edge set with the timestamp t. The TEC measures the amount of randomness that a node may infect. That<br>is, if a node vi has a greater number of directly connected neighbors, the node has more possible outcomes, and thus the information of vi will be larger. In this<br>case, a possible outcome means node vi infects a specific number of neighbors.<br>In this paper, we define Lti as the neighbor set of vi at snapshot t. Lt<br>i containsall the directly connected nodes of vi at snapshot t. Let |Lti| be the number of neighbors of vi at t, the information of vi, denoted as Hti , can be estimated by the following equation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><img src="http://ww1.sinaimg.cn/large/0060lm7Tly1fmk6wasnhtj312h05bglx.jpg" alt="Markdown"></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In Eq. 1, Cm|Lti| denotes the number of m-combinations from |Lti| number of neighbors of vi, and thus Cm |Lti| 2|Lti| is the probability that node vi may infect m number of neighbors. For each timestamped graph,the centrality of a node vi can be normalized as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><img src="http://ww1.sinaimg.cn/large/0060lm7Tly1fmk6w9yz51j312c044dfx.jpg" alt="Markdown"></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the computer virus propagation process, a node’s influence at snapshot t<br>is not only determined by the number of its current neighbors, but also affected<br>by its neighbors’ influences in the future. Taking into account this aspect, the<br>influence of a node vi at snapshot t, as denoted as Iti in this paper, can be defined as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><img src="http://ww1.sinaimg.cn/large/0060lm7Tly1fmk6wa4p6xj3128061wf1.jpg" alt="Markdown"></p>
</blockquote>
<p>where p ∈ [0, 1] is a parameter to denote how node vi at t + 1 determines its<br>influence at time t. Specifically, for node vi in the last timestamped graph, we<br>assume that its influence is only determined by its infection uncertainty, i.e.,ITi = H˜ Ti , because we do not know its neighbors’ influences in the subsequent<br>snapshot. When t = 1, the influence of each node has considered the cumulative<br>effects of its neighbors over the whole time period. That means, we can use the<br>influence of each node at t = 1 to measure its importance in computer virus<br>propagation process on a temporal network.</p>
<p>###2.2 ITTCC Algorithm<br>Based on the deﬁnitions forTEC,we propose ITTCC algorithm for calculating node inﬂuences. The ITTCC algorithm is an recursive algorithm in which the inﬂuence of a nodev at t is calculated based on its current neighbors’inﬂuences i at t+1. The ITTCC algorithm is given as follows.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><img src="http://ww1.sinaimg.cn/large/0060lm7Tly1fmk6wa69n2j312q0mgmzt.jpg" alt="Markdown"></p>
</blockquote>
<p>###2.3 A Numerical Example<br>To demonstrate the estimating process of our proposed method, Table 1 presents<br>the centralities for nodes in the toy temporal network (as shown in Fig. 1) based<br>on TEC. For this calculation, we assume the parameter p is 0.05. As shown in<br>Table 1, the most influential spreaders as identified by the degree centrality on<br>the aggregated static network are nodes 1, 4, and 6 because the three have more<br>neighbors than other nodes. The nodes’ centralities are quite different by using<br>the measures of TBC and TCC. TBC and TCC find that node 6 is the most<br>influential node. However, the top influential node as located by TEC is node</p>
<ol>
<li>This is perhaps because node 4, one of the neighbors of node 3 at t2, has a<br>connection with node 6 at t3, which has the largest number of neighbors and<br>thus has the highest influence.</li>
</ol>
<p>##3 Experiments and Results<br>In order to demonstrate the effectiveness of TEC in identifying important nodes,<br>we examine it on three synthetic temporal networks and a real email network.<br>Two well-known metrics, i.e., TBC and TCC, are employed as benchmark methods<br>for comparison. On each network, we first utilize TEC, TBC, and TCC to<br>identify the most influential node, respectively.Then, we set the identified most<br>influential node as the infection source in the corresponding network and run<br>simulations based on the classic SIR model. The spreading of each identified<br>infection source node is quantified by the number of new infected nodes in total.During the simulation, we set the virus spreading rate β = 0.9, and the recovery<br>rate μ = 0.2. Each simulation runs 100 times to eliminate the bias caused by the<br>random number.</p>

<p>###3.1 Synthetic and SWU-Email Networks</p>
<p>We generate a temporal random (TR) network, a temporal small-world (TSW)<br>network, and a temporal scale-free (TSF) network by repetitively utilizing the<br>Erd¨os-R´enyi random network model [11], the Watts-Strogatz small-world network<br>model [12], and the Barab´asi-Albert scale-free network model [13], respectively.<br>In this work, each temporal network contains 365 timestamped graphs<br>with 500 vertices. In our research scenario, each timestamped graph represents<br>the interaction structures between individuals in a day.<br>The email data used in this study is supported by the Southwest University<br>(SWU), China. This dataset includes 167545 emails that sent or received by<br>campus users in January, 2013 (29 days in total). To ensure that the data do<br>indeed reflect the interactions between campus users, we filtered out the emails<br>that were not sent or received from SWU email server. To construct a network<br>based on SWU-email dataset, we used the window size of 24 h (from 0am to 12pm<br>in a day) to preprocess the complete temporal network into 29 timestamped,<br>undirected, and unweighted graphs. That is, campus users are regarded as the<br>nodes in each timestamped graph. If two campus users exchanged at least one<br>email in a specific day, there will be an undirected edge added between the two<br>nodes on the corresponding timestamped graph.</p>
<p>###3.2 Results</p>
<p>Figure 2 shows the spread of computer viruses based on SIR model in the TR<br>network, TSW network, TSF network, and SWU-email network respectively.<br>Please note that in the TSF network, the most influencing nodes as identified by<br>the three measures are the same. In this case, we set the second most influencing<br>node that is identified by each measure as the infection source. From Fig. 2, we<br>can see that the total number of infected nodes each day in the case of using TEC<br>to set the infection source is higher than that employing TBC and TCC. This<br>finding is also supported by the inner small figures in Fig. 2, which shows that<br>at the initial few days, the infection source that is recognized by the measure<br>of TEC infects more susceptible nodes. This reveal that our method is more<br>accurate than the TBC and TCC.</p>
<p>In ITTCC algorithm, we have to calculate the entropy for each node in<br>the last snapshot graph, and based which to calculate the influences of nodes</p>

<p>Fig. 2. The accuracy of three centrality measures in evaluating the nodes’ spreading<br>influences according to the SIR model in the temporal random network (a), temporal<br>small-world network (b), temporal scale-free network (c), and temporal SWU-email network (d).</p>
<p>backwards along time. Thus the time complexity of the proposed algorithm is<br>the time complexity of computing the node entropy multiplied by the number of<br>nodes in the network, and then multiply the number of snapshots in a temporal<br>network. Therefore, the time complexity of ITTCC algorithm can be represented<br>as O(g(k) ∗ n ∗ T). Here, g(k) is the time complexity of calculate the entropy<br>for a node; k is the largest number of neighbors for a node in the last snapshot<br>graph; and n = |V |. The complexity of the fastest method for calculating the<br>combination in Eq. 1 is O(k). Therefore, the time complexity of the proposed<br>algorithm is O(n2 ∗ T) if k = n.</p>
<p>##4 Conclusions</p>
<p>Identifying influential nodes is a fundamental problem before any control<br>strategies on the spread of computer viruses. To address this problem, most<br>existing studies only consider the topological structure of a static network.<br>This assumption does not always hold in the real world because most connections<br>in a network are dynamically changing over time. In this paper, besides<br>the topological structure of each snapshot graph, we further take into account<br>the relationships between nodes’ influences at different time. That is, if a node<br>connects to more nodes and which have more influential neighbors in the future,<br>this node will get higher influence. As entropy is an effective way to measure the<br>uncertainty of a node’s influence in virus spreading, we has proposed an temporal<br>entropy-based centrality and an ITTCC algorithm for calculating nodes’<br>influences in a temporal network. According to the numerical analysis on a toy<br>temporal network, as well as the simulation results of the SIR model on three<br>synthetic temporal networks and a real network, the temporal entropy-based centrality can identify higher influence nodes than temporal betweenness centrality<br>and temporal closeness centrality. We are in the process of further examining<br>sensitivities with respect to different p, and evaluating the effectiveness of our<br>method in more real world propagation process and temporal networks.</p>
